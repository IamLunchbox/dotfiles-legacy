# dotfiles

This is my dotfile-repository, which is used in conjunction with dotbot. 
Since i3 will support an include function from version 4.20 on, this repository will be a legacy-version for desktop systems using i3 versions < 4.20.
https://github.com/IamLunchbox/dotfiles will be the maintained upstream, while this repository will remain for legacy reasons and will possibly be archived in the future.
